## Welcome to Arduino Stream Deck Catalog

I'm Kadu, a twitch.tv streamer, in my show I talk about Maker things, like Internet of Things, Home Automation, and Arduino related things. On my first shows I have a brilliant idea, let me create my own Stream Deck, After my adventures creating my StreamDeck, I saw that a lot of other streamers on twitch.tv already created their own version of Stream Deck, some simple, others complex with Oled Display. My idea is to create this Catalog that anyone can show your StreamDeck here, just do a Pull Request, let's share!
